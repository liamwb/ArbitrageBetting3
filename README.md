# ArbitrageBetting3

This is a program for finding arbitrage opportunities. It uses theOdds API to get odds from a variety of bookies,
and then finds the best arbitrage opportunities among them. This version can deal with odds including and not including 
draws.

It should be noted that arbitrage betting is probably not realistic  way to make money. Profit margins (when they exist)
are usually very narrow, and you run the risk of having one half of your bet cancelled on you. Not to mention if a bookie
works out what you're doing you'll probably get banned from betting with them. This was a programming excercise, not a way
to make money.

To run this script, you will need to create a file called 'api_key'.txt in the same folder as the arbitrage3.py file. It must contain a
key for The Odds API (which you can get here: https://the-odds-api.com/).
